        <h1>Nigerian Fried Rice</h1>
        <section class="about">
          <p>
            Nigerian Fried Rice! Hmmm! The second most popular rice dish in
            Nigeria; A must have at parties and a major meal in most homes. It’s
            tagged “Nigerian Fried Rice” obviously cos there are various recipes
            out there but the popular African recipe is the Nigerian Fried Rice.
            Now, there are several methods of cooking Nigerian Fried Rice. Some
            recipes call for parboiling of the rice and then adding stock and
            veggies, then cooking till doneness. Others require cooking the
            rice, adding cooking oil and stock and then fried veggies then cook
            till desired doneness. These methods are classic and tested,
            however, I’ve always had my own method which is what I’ll be teaching.
